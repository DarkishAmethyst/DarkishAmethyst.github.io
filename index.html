<body>    <h1>Social Links:</h1>
  <div class="intro-container">
      </div>
</body> ```

Because of this, the browser is likely ignoring the first `<body>` tag and the content inside it, or it's misinterpreting the closing `</body>` tags, causing your image and text to fall outside of the structure you intended.

### ✅ The Fix: Merge and Correct Your HTML

You need to **combine all your content** into a single `<body>` block. Also, your social links (`<a>` tags) should be *outside* the `intro-container`.

Here is the corrected and cleaned-up version of your `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  <title>DarkishAmethyst</title>
</head>
<body>  <h1>Social Links:</h1>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@darkishamethyst">YouTube</a><br>
  <a href="https://discord.gg/huE2vbKqat">Discord</a><br>

    <p class="intro-text">
      Hi, I'm Amethyst, a transgirl who really enjoys coding and is interested in roleplaying... So I was thinking about putting those two things together and that is how I came up with the idea of creating my MCRP called Realisations.
